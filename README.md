1. Trading patterns:
    1.1 **Head and Shoulder and inverse Head and Shoulder**: These patterns indicate a potential reversal in the market, with the "head" being the highest point, and the "shoulders" being the points on either side at a slightly lower level.
    1.2 **Multiple top and bottom**: These patterns indicate a range-bound market, with multiple highs and lows forming a horizontal range.
    1.3 **Horizontal support and resistance**: These patterns indicate key levels at which the market has previously struggled to break through.
    1.4 **Ascending and Descending Triangle pattern**: These patterns indicate a potential breakout in the market, with the upper trendline being resistance and the lower trendline being support.
    1.5 **Wedge up and down**: These patterns indicate a potential reversal in the market, with the trendlines converging towards each other.
    1.6 **Channel up and down**: These patterns indicate a strong trend in the market, with price moving within a well-defined upper and lower trendline.
    1.7 **Double top and bottom**: These patterns indicate a potential reversal in the market, with the market hitting a high or low twice and then reversing.
    1.8 **Trend line support and resistance**: These patterns indicate key levels at which the market is likely to experience support or resistance based on historical price action.

2. Designed for fast performance:
    2.1 Uses only Pandas as Numpy, no other external libraries: This approach helps to keep the library lightweight and fast.
    2.2 Uses the concept of vectorization: This approach helps to improve performance by processing large amounts of data at once, rather than iterating over each individual data point.

3. New and Unique:
    3.1 No other python library exists for such task currently: This library is new and unique, as it aims to provide an all-in-one solution for identifying various trading patterns.

4. Future add-ons:
    4.1 Request your favourite pattern to get added in the list: The library is open for suggestions for adding new patterns.
    4.2 Work on visualization and plotting: The library can be extended to include visualization and plotting features to help users better understand the patterns identified.
    4.3 Add unit testing: The library can be extended to include unit testing to ensure that the code is working as expected and to catch any bugs early on.
